# Information

Included is a large amount of the code used to make the figures and tables for my KU MSc thesis hand-in. The code I wrote can be found in `src/main-code`, the other directories in `src` contain scripts I did not write but imported functions from.

Missing from this repository is pipeline CELLECT-LDSC which will be made publicly available eventually, here: https://github.com/perslab/CELLECT.

Also absent is the package for calculating expression specificity, CELLEX, which will be made publicly available eventually, here: https://github.com/perslab/CELLEX
